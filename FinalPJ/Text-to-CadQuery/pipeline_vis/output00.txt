cq.exporters.export(assembly, "./stlcq/0035/00351540.stl")<|endoftext|>Create a rectangular prism with rounded edges by starting with a new coordinate system that is rotated and translated according to specified angles and vectors. Draw a two-dimensional sketch on the first face, forming a loop with four lines to create a rectangle. Scale this sketch to reduce its size, then transform it into three dimensions by applying the rotation and translation from the coordinate system. Extrude the transformed sketch to generate the three-dimensional model. The final shape has a length of approximately 0.1667 units, a width of about 0.0833 units, and a height of 0.6667 units. This process results in a solid body that can be used as a component in larger assemblies.
